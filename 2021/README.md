# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains the code that I have written to solve Advent of Code 2021 problems. Depending on the problem, I may choose different languages to solve, and I may possibly solve a single problem in multiple languages to strengthen my skills across languages, but I am not planning to solve all problems in all languages.

I will try to always solve each day's problem on my own without any outside help in one of the below languages; then, I may try to migrate to another language to strengthen my "language translation" skills in  look to others' solutions to see if my code could have used some improvements.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is a language I use often but I do not feel as strong in it as I do in C#, so I will try to also solve a few in TypeScript as well.

## Kotlin

I do not have very much experience with Kotlin and I look forward to using these activities as a way to refamiliarize myself with the language. I will try to solve some puzzles by myself, and I will occasionally refer to the [Advent of Code 2021 in Kotlin](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlFc5cFwUnmy2hYx6k3TjjFLd7QXH2CjF) YouTube series by JetBrains to see how their proposed solutions compare and if there were additional language features that could have been used.
