# Advent of Code 2020

The first year in which I participated in Advent of Code was 2021. 2020 is the first year that I went back to revisit,
years afterward, as a way to demonstrate how to solve Advent of Code.

This is where I will be storing my solutions to Advent of Code 2020.

## Go

Go was the primary language of choice for Advent of Code 2024, so the demonstration used when puzzles from 2020 were
solved also used Go.
