# Advent of Code 2022

This is where I will be storing my solutions to Advent of Code 2022.

## PHP

I am starting Advent of Code this year with the intent of using PHP to solve as many problems as I can as a way of
becoming more comfortable with the language.

## Visual Basic 6.0

For a lighthearted challenge, I will also be solving some problems in Visual Basic 6.0.

## Kotlin

As with last year, I will also solve some puzzles in Kotlin to learn the language through following along in
the [Kotlin YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlFc5cFwUnmwxQlKf8uWp-la8BVSTH47J).

## Go

Go is another language that was good to learn at the time during Advent of Code 2022, but was mostly not used until
later years.
