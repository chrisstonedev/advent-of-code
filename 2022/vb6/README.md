# Advent of Code 2022 in Visual Basic 6.0

## How to run

To develop and run the program, you will need to install the Visual Basic 6.0 IDE, which is [no longer supported on any version of Windows that is still supported by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-basic-6/visual-basic-6-support-policy#the-visual-basic-60-ide).

To run the unit tests, you will also need to install [SimplyVBUnit](https://github.com/kellyethridge/SimplyVBUnit) on your machine.

With the Visual Basic 6.0 IDE open, go to Tools, then Options, and in the General tab, within the Error Trapping frame, make sure the setting is set to "Break on Unhandled Errors".
